# The-Chase

In the game "The Chase", there exists a player and a computer (as the chaser).

The game is seperated to 3 stages:

1) The player will be asked 3 diffrent randomized question.
   
   Each correct answer will add 5,000 to the balance of the player.
   
   At the end of this stage, if the player didn't get any correct answer,
   
   the game is over. The player can choose to play another game
   
   
2) At this stage, the Player will need to choose the level at which he will start away from the chaser.
  
   the chaser starts at level 0, and the player can choose the starting position on board:
   1) Start from level 2 with double the balance from his first stage
   2) start from level 3 with the same balance from his first stage
   3) start from level 4 with half the balance from his first stage
  
3) At this stage, the player and the Chaser will be asked the same question.  

   The questions are multiple choice questions.
   
   Each correct answer' the player proceeds to the next level.
   
   The players goal is to reach the "Bank" (found in level 7).
   
   Each wrong answer' keeps the player in his position.
   
   If the Chaser (Computer) chooses the correct answer, it proceeds to the next level, getting closer to the Player.
   
   If the chaser reached the player before he gets to the "Bank", the game is over.
